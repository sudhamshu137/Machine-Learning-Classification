Machine Learning models for classification on a dataset 

</br>
<h2>Who buys SUV?</h2>
A dataset with age and salary of the people coming to the SUV showroom and whether they bought the SUV or not!
Two machine learning models: Support Vector Classification and K Nearest Neighbors models built based on the dataset and KNN model found out be the best suited classifier as it has the accuracy score of 93% whereas the SV classifier found out to be 90% accurate.</br>
Therefore KNN model chosen to work with this dataset.
